# Frost-Impacts-on-Beech-Productivity-Sentinel2
NOTE: This information will be published on the submission of the associated PhD thesis in March 2026.

This repository contains the workflows for data processing, analysis, and figure-generation supporting the study:

Beese, L. V. J., Jucker, T., Dalponte, M., (2026).
Sentinel-2 NDVI Time-Series Detects Impacts of Late Spring Frost on Canopy Phenology in montane Beech Forests.

The study uses Sentinel-2 time series (NDVI / phenology metrics) to quantify the impacts of late-spring frost events on forest productivity, focusing on Trentino, Italy and European beech.

## Code overview

The `Code/` directory contains scripts used to:
  * Acquire / ingest Sentinel-2 time series (or load pre-extracted products)
  * Preprocess imagery and compute vegetation indices / time-series summaries
  * Define frost metrics / event windows (e.g., pre-frost baseline, impact period, recovery period)
  * Fit statistical models (e.g., mixed-effects / GAMs / non-linear terms) linking frost severity to productivity outcomes
  * Generate figures and summary tables used in the manuscript/chapter

* * *
## Data availability

Some raw datasets are not included due to size, licensing, and access restrictions.

The `Data/` directory contains:
  * Placeholder files and README notes describing data sources and preprocessing steps
  * Derived metrics and cleaned datasets sufficient to reproduce analyses and figures, where redistribution is permitted

Please contact the author for guidance on accessing restricted datasets.

## Reproducibility

Analyses were conducted primarily in R.
Users should ensure that package versions are compatible with those current at the time of analysis.

* * *
## How to run the analysis

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Install required R packages (or restore `renv`, if provided)
  3. Populate the `Data/` directory according to the notes provided
  4. Run scripts in the `Code/` directory (recommended order: 00 → 05)
  5. Outputs (figures and tables) will be written to `Figures/` and relevant output folders
